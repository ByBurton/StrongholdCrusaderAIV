# StrongholdCrusaderAIV
This project was started to serve as a substitute to [Evrey](https://github.com/Evrey) 's AI Villages, as well as [Tatha](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4BrhBzHp1ymnczlkdKcSkg)'s.

Special thanks will probably go to:
 -  [heroesflorian](https://github.com/heroesflorian) , who helped me for yeaaaaaaaars
    by checking my created aiv files for mistakes.
 -  [Udwin](https://www.youtube.com/user/UdwinLP) who reminds me almost daily what an awesome game Stronghold Crusader is
 -  [Sh0wdown](https://github.com/Sh0wdown) for reigniting my love for this game
 -  [Evrey](https://github.com/Evrey) for helping me with AI Villages via discord and YouTube as well
 -  [FireFly Studios](https%3A%2F%2Ffireflyworlds.com) for the best game to date: Stronghold Crusader
    (buy it on [steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/40970/Stronghold_Crusader_HD/) !

I will create 8 castles for each of the lords, will try to stay close to the original ones,
with maybe a few exceptions. I also will add a healer to my favourite Lords (Rat, Wolf, Caliph), as I just love
the idea behind them. And every army has had healers.
Even barbarians. I know, I know. The Caliph? The Rat? Yes. Sorry.

Images for each aiv will be included.
I won't fix any problems the vanilla AI has.

Changes made:

Ratty: Rat has 5 statues, and a healer.


Installation is simple: goto your Stronghold Crusader installation directory, backup your AIV folder and then copy all the AI villages from my project you like into that folder.


ToDo: Fix this horrible formating and stuff..
