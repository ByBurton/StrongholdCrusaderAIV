# StrongholdCrusaderAIV
This project was started, as a substitute to [Evrey](https://github.com/Evrey) 's AI Villages, as well as [Tatha](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4BrhBzHp1ymnczlkdKcSkg)'s.

Special thanks will probably go to [heroesflorian](https://github.com/heroesflorian) , who helped me for yeaaaaaaaars
by checking my created aiv files for mistakes.

I will create 8 castles for each of the lords, will try to stay close to the original ones,
with maybe a few exceptions. I also will add a healer to my favourite Lords (Rat, Wolf, Caliph), as I just love
the idea behind them. And every army has had healers.
Even barbarians. I know, I know. The Caliph? The Rat? Yes. Sorry.

Images for each aiv will be included.

Changes made:

Ratty: Rat has 5 statues, and a healer.


Installation is simple: goto your Stronghold Crusader installation directory, backup your AIV folder and then copy all the AI villages from my project you like into that folder.
