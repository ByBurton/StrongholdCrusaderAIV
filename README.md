# StrongholdCrusaderAIV
This project was started by me, because I was not satisfied with Evreys or Tatha's 
AI Villages as much as I hoped I would be. So this will be my attempt.
I don't mean to sound offending here. It is just personal taste, and I still use Evrey's
for skirmish trail missions.

Special thanks will probably go to @heroesflorian , who helped me for yeaaaaaaaars
by checking my created aiv files for mistakes.

I will create 8 castles for each of the lords, will try to stay close to the original ones,
with maybe a few exceptions. I also will add a healer to my favourite Lords (Rat, Wolf, Caliph), as I just love
the idea behind them. And every army has had healers.
Even barbarians. I know, I know. The Caliph? The Rat? Yes. Sorry.

Images for each aiv will be included.

Changes made:

Ratty: Rat has 5 statues, and a healer.
