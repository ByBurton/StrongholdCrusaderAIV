# StrongholdCrusaderAIV
This project was started to serve as a substitute to [Evrey](https://github.com/Evrey) 's AI Villages, as well as [Tatha](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4BrhBzHp1ymnczlkdKcSkg)'s.

Special thanks will probably go to:

    by checking my created aiv files for mistakes.

 -  [Sh0wdown](https://github.com/Sh0wdown) for reigniting my love for this game
 -  [Evrey](https://github.com/Evrey) for helping me with AI Villages via discord and YouTube as well
 -  [FireFly Studios](https://fireflyworlds.com) for the best game to date: Stronghold Crusader

 -------

I will create 8 castles for each of the lords, will try to stay close to the original ones,
with maybe a few exceptions. I also will add a healer to my favourite Lords (Rat, Wolf, Caliph), as I just love
the idea behind them. And every army has had healers.
Even barbarians. I know, I know. The Caliph? The Rat? Yes. Sorry.

Images for each aiv will be included.
I won't fix any problems the vanilla AI has.

-------

Changes made:

Ratty: Rat has 5 statues, and a healer. 

Piggy: More negative things, more wells. Patroulling macemen. 

Wolf: Random fear factor (good, neutral, evil). Healers around towers. A lot of weapon industry. Patroulling swordsmen and pikemen, but the later don't work.

(I included a textfile called style in each AI folder. It describes what my castles are based on.)


------


Installation is simple: goto your Stronghold Crusader installation directory, backup your AIV folder and then copy all the AI villages from my project you like into that folder.

------

Order in which I want to include the AI Villages:

1. Rat
2. Pig
3. Wolf
4. Caliph
5. Snake
6. Saladin
7. Richard
8. Sultan
-----
9. Wazir
10. Emir
11. Sheriff
12. Frederick
13. Nazir
14. Philip
15. Marshal
16. God damn Abbot

ToDo: Fix this horrible formating and stuff..
